# MyBlog

Welcome to **MyBlog**! This application includes essential features such as CRUD operations for posts, comments, and tags, as well as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), OAuth2 login, and JWT-based authentication. This is my first project developed while learning React JS, so it may not be perfect, but it has been a great learning experience.

## Getting Started

Please follow the README files located in the `backend` and `frontend` folders for detailed setup instructions.

## Contributing

I would be delighted if you could contribute to the development of MyBlog. Your ideas and improvements are welcome! Please create a new issue, and we can discuss how to enhance the project together.

I hope this project helps you learn React JS as well!
